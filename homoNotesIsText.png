1.2 The transformation is defined by a homography, because the two images are projections of the same planar space.

1.3 4, though i have no idea why

1.7 because the two planes are the unchanged through the entire sequence

1.8 RECALIBRATION IN THE HOUSE!

1.12 Benefit: linearity. (a change dx,dy on the map is equally large no matter where it starts)
fails: should fail on the stairway (though it is actually pretty close)

2.23 (og 25) Given that T and M are actually the same "plane", Ht->g = Hm->g = (Hg->m)^-1 and then some scaling.
