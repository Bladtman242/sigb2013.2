\section{Texture mapping}

\subsection{Linear Texture mapping}
The problem solved in this section can be described as follows:
\newline
Given two images of the same surface, a texture is mapped onto one based on a homography between the two obtained through 4 selected points in one of the images. 

The steps to achieve this are few. 

First, a homography is obtained between the two images through 4 selected
points in the
