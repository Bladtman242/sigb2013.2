\section{Introduction}

This is the second mandatory assignment for the course SIGB F2013. In this
assignment we will explore the use of homographies in order to transform points
between
planes in images, texture mapping, and camera calibration. This will
be done in the programming language python with help from the libraries
opencv,numpy, and matplotlib.
