\section{Introduction}

This is the second mandatory assignment for the course SIGB F2013. In this
assignment we will explore the use of homographies in order to translate points between
planes in images, texture mapping, and camera calibration. This will
be done in the programming language python with help from the libraries
opencv,numpy, and matplotlib.

This report is an attempt to document what has been done to make this gaze
tracker.
