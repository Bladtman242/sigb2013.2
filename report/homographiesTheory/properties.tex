\section{Homographies}
outline:%may delegate to files
\begin{itemize}
	\item basics (matrix, rotation, translation, skew, non commutative(?) )
	\item representation (homogeneity)
	\item properties (transforms between planes, associative (applied as
	functions)
	\item finding homographies (if time+page-space, this can get looong)
\end{itemize}
