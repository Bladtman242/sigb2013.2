%\item representation (homogeneity)
\subsection{Representation}
The operations described in the previous section can be neatly packaged into
matrix form:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	r,sc & r,sh & t_{x} \\
	r,sh & r,sc & t_{y} \\
	h_{31} & h_{32} & hom
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where $r,sc$ are combined rotation and scaling parameters, $r,sh$ are combined
rotation and shearing parameters, $t_{x}$ and $t_{y}$ are translation
parameters for the x and y axis respectively, and $hom$ is there to accommodate
homogeneity. 

Homogeneous coordinates in an $n$-dimensional space is represented as a vector
in $n+1$-dimensional space. So a two-dimensional, Cartesian point in Euclidean
geometry, $(x,y)$, is represented as the three-dimensional, homogeneous point
$(zx,zy,z)$ in projective geometry.  The homogeneous representation allows
multiplication with a (non-zero) scalar, without changing the position of the
coordinate. Perhaps more notably in this context, it allows $n$-dimensional
points to be multiplied with $(n+1)\times (n+1)$ matrices.
